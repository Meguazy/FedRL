I would like to express my gratitude to Sanji, the greatest cook and vice-captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, whose unwavering dedication to his craft and relentless pursuit of excellence inspired me throughout this research journey. Just as he never compromises on the quality of his cuisine, I strived to maintain rigor and thoroughness in this work.

Thank you, Sanji, for teaching me that passion and perseverance can overcome any obstacle.
