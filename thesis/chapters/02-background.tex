\chapter{Background and Related Work}

This chapter provides the theoretical foundation for our clustered federated deep reinforcement learning framework. We begin by describing our literature search methodology to ensure transparency and reproducibility. We then provide an overview of reinforcement learning fundamentals and the AlphaZero algorithm that forms the basis of our chess engine. We introduce federated learning principles and discuss how they can be adapted to reinforcement learning settings. Finally, we review related work in distributed reinforcement learning, behavioral diversity preservation, and federated learning applications.
