"""
Server aggregation package.

This package contains aggregation algorithms for federated learning model updates.
It handles both intra-cluster and inter-cluster aggregation strategies for different
chess playstyles.

Modules:
    base_aggregator: Base classes and interfaces for aggregation algorithms
    intra_cluster_aggregator: Aggregation within clusters (same playstyle)
    inter_cluster_aggregator: Cross-cluster aggregation for global models

Note: Aggregation modules are currently stubs and need implementation.
