# P2: Share Middle Layers Only - Selective Aggregation Experiment
# Tests hypothesis that sharing mid-level abstractions while allowing independent
# early feature extraction and late decision-making enables playstyle divergence

# Expected outcomes for P2:
# - High global divergence (cosine similarity 0.65-0.75 for heads)
# - Strong playstyle separation (tactical score difference 0.15-0.20)
# - Moderate ELO (1250-1450) with shared mid-level patterns
# - Tactical cluster: high tactical score (> 0.62), forcing play
# - Positional cluster: low tactical score (< 0.52), positional maneuvering
# - Middle layers converge (shared), early/late layers and heads diverge
# - Tests if mid-level tactical pattern sharing benefits both styles
# - Most experimental of P1-P4: independent input and output with shared middle
